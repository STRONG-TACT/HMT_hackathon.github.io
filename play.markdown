## How to Play
Dice Adventure is now available on [itch.io](https://cmu-tact.itch.io/dice-adventure). We will also release a local build of the game for players to explore and for developers to test their agents. You can jump on the game and play at any time from **May 8, 2024** to **July 21, 2024**. The AI agent will be online on **June 15, 2024**. Virtual match making events will be hosted between **July 15, 2024** and **July 21, 2024**. The game supports two play modes --- the *practice* mode and the *competition* mode. In the *practice* mode, you can switch between the three characters to get familiar with the game. The *competition* mode will only be available at match-making events.

## Match-making Events

<!-- signup link for competitions -->
We will be organizing a series of in-person and virtual match-making events. The [signup link]() will be posted soon. Though players can form any teams when playing the game, only hybrid teams will be considered as competition entries and can compete for the cash prize. There are two allocations for the hybrid teams: 
1. Two human players and one AI agent
2. One human player and two AI agents.

- **In-person**: there will be a game competition at the in-person hackathon. Please see the [hackathon](/hackathon/) page for detailed schedule. 
- **Online**: we will be organizing a few virtual match-making events outside of the in-person hackathon event. Detailed information and schedule will be posted soon.
