## How to Play
Dice Adventure will be available on itch.io by May 8, 2024. We will also release a local build of the game for players to explore and for developers to test their agents. You can jump on the game and play at any time from **May 8, 2024** to **July 1, 2024**. The game supports two play modes --- the *exhibition* mode and the *tournament* mode. In the *exhibition* mode, you can select from a list of currently available agents you want to play with and assign rolse to the agent. The *tournament* mode will only be available at match-making event.

## Match-making Events

We will be organizing a series of in-person and virtual match-making events. The [signup link]() will be posted soon.

There are two allocations for the hybrid teams: 
1. Two human players and one AI agent
2. One human player and two AI agents.
